# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions. First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory. Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn.

1. Why would you use the method super()?

  Your answer: To "inheret" or take the properties and methods of another class.

  Researched answer: The super() method is used within the constructor of one class to call on the constructor of another class. 



2. What is a virtual DOM?

  Your answer: I don't know exactly, I now it helps React work. 

  Researched answer: A virtual DOM keeps the actual UI in sync with what the code wants it to be.



3. When creating a basic (stateless) class component in React, what are the necessary elements needed to display "Hello World" in the browser?

  Your answer: First you need to use the class keyword to declare a class and extend Component from React. Then you would use a constructor and super keyword to create your class and inheret the necessary properties from React. Finally, you need to use the something method and return method to display the component, written in JSX, an HTML like language. 

  Researched answer: Render! You need to render it all after the class declaration section using the render keyword followed by the return and JSX. 



4. What is JSX?

  Your answer: An HTML like language created by Facebook to allow for HTML markup in a javascript file. 

  Researched answer: It isn't an actual programming language so much as a syntax used with React to make it easier for programmers to create a UI. 



5. What is state in React?

  Your answer: The state are the main paramaters of a React application that need to be continually checked and updated as user input is received to keep the UI up-to-date. 

  Researched answer: The state is, more accurately, an optional object assigned to a React module that stores any dynamic data that needs to be checked and updated. 



6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

  Your answer: Hoisting is a property of JavaScript where a variable can be called upon before it is actually declared. 

  Researched answer: It is important to note that this only works if you declare the variable rather than initialize it (give it a value when you give it a name)



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

- React lifecycle methods - Methods used to mount components and ensure/modify communication between the DOM and UI
- event.preventDefault() - Cancels an event if it is cancelable 
- DOM events - Allow JavaScript to register different event handlers, allowing you to run certain codes at certain times
- React props - Arbitrary inputs that allow React to display what is supposed to be on screen
- onChange - Detects when the value of an input element changes
